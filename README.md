# Assalamualaikum! Merhaba!
<p align="justify">
As an experienced Web Developer from Indonesia, I have the ability to build websites using cutting-edge technologies such as the CodeIgniter, Laravel, and Vue.js frameworks. I have both individual and team working experience, allowing me to efficiently and effectively complete tasks and projects. My current focus is on improving my skills as a Front End Developer by learning new technologies and participating in open source projects. Additionally, I have a hobby of sharing my knowledge of programming through Github. I am confident that my skills and experience, along with my passion for sharing knowledge, will be highly valuable in helping a company or team achieve their goals.</p>
